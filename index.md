## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Eletrical and Computer Engineering @ UCLA.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Physics and AI, with the focus on physics-informed machine learning and physics-inspired algorithms. Currently I am working in [Jalali-Lab](https://photonics.ucla.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof.Bahram Jalali](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/bahram-jalali/). I also worked with [Prof.Vwani Roychowdhury](http://www.vwaniroychowdhury.com/). Prior to UCLA, I got my B.E. in Eletronic Information Engineering from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
